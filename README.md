# Toilethereum Flush to Earn Prototype

The Flush to Earn prototype explores the idea of rewarding users for participation in the Toilethereum ecosystem.  
Each flush action represents an on-chain event that triggers a reward mechanism distributing $TOILETH tokens from the reward pool.

## Objectives
- Simulate flush events and token rewards before mainnet deployment  
- Test reward ratios, gas costs and fairness models  
- Create early user interaction mockups for the Flush to Earn app  

## Repository Contents
- **docs** – design documentation and reward logic:  
  - [System Overview](docs/system_overview.md)  
  - [Reward Mechanics](docs/reward_mechanics.md)  
  - [User Flow](docs/user_flow.md)  

## Technical Direction
The first prototype of the FlushContract will be deployed on the Ethereum testnet.  
The contract will include:  
- ERC20 reward pool  
- Flush event tracking  
- Adjustable emission rate and streak bonuses  
- DAO controlled parameters  

## Current Phase
Design and simulation testing.  
Smart contract implementation will begin after Phase 2 of the Litepaper roadmap.
