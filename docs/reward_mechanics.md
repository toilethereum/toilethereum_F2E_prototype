# Reward Mechanics

Each flush is treated as a blockchain event recorded by the FlushContract.  
Rewards are distributed based on participation, streaks and pool balance.

## Basic Model
• Each flush triggers a base reward, for example 0.001 $TOILETH  
• Reward decreases as the pool depletes  
• DAO can adjust the gas compensation ratio  

## Streak Bonus
Users who flush daily for multiple consecutive days earn multipliers  
3 days = 1.1x reward  
7 days = 1.5x reward  
30 days = NFT Golden Plunger  

## Deflationary Mechanism
A small percentage of each reward, for example 1 percent, is burned to maintain scarcity and long term value.

## Anti Spam Rules
• Only one valid flush per wallet every set number of minutes  
• Contract validates unique user actions  
• Repeated or suspicious flush attempts are ignored
