# User Flow

## Step 1 Connect Wallet
The user connects MetaMask or WalletConnect to the Flush App.

## Step 2 Initiate Flush
The user presses the Flush button. The app sends a transaction to the smart contract.

## Step 3 Smart Contract Event
FlushContract verifies user eligibility and distributes the reward.

## Step 4 Token Reward
$TOILETH tokens are transferred from the RewardPool to the user wallet.

## Step 5 Visual Feedback
The app shows a flush animation with water and coins to symbolize success.

## Step 6 Streak Tracking
The flush streak and reward multiplier update in real time.  
This process ensures transparency, verifiability and humor, which are central to the Toilethereum philosophy.
