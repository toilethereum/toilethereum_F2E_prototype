# System Overview

The Flush to Earn system rewards blockchain interaction through humor and engagement.  
Each flush event is a symbolic but verifiable transaction that interacts with the $TOILETH ecosystem.

## Core Components
1. FlushContract handles events and rewards  
2. RewardPool stores and distributes tokens  
3. FlushTracker logs unique wallet activity  
4. Frontend App allows user interactions  
5. DAO Governance manages reward parameters and pool refills  

## Concept Flow
User presses Flush → transaction sent to FlushContract → reward distributed → transaction logged → user receives $TOILETH tokens.  
The system is modular and upgradeable without breaking older versions.
